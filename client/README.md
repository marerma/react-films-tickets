Clone the repository, go to client directory and make a crosscheck.

**Please ensure that the server is running on port 3001.**

```
git clone
cd react-films-tickets/client
git checkout develop
npm install
npm run dev (runs project in dev mode)
```

**please ensure that the server is running on port 3001.**

You can also start server from *client directory*, but you need firstly to install node dependencies in react-films-tickets/server:

```
cd react-films-tickets/server
git checkout develop
npm install
```
